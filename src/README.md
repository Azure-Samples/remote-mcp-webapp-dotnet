# MCP Server with Multiple Tools

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can be hosted on Azure App Service. The server supports streamable HTTP transport and implements several useful tools including multiplication, temperature conversion, and weather data.

## Features

- MCP server implementation using the C# SDK
- Support for streamable HTTP transport
- CORS enabled for browser clients
- Multiple useful tools:
  - Multiplication tool for number calculations
  - Temperature conversion tools (Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa)
  - Weather tools for retrieving forecasts and alerts
- Ready for Azure App Service deployment

## Development

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later

### Running Locally

To run the server locally:

```bash
dotnet run --project McpServer.csproj
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:5000.

### Testing the Available Tools

You can use any MCP client that supports HTTP transport to connect to the server and use the following tools:

#### Multiplication Tool
The multiplication tool takes two parameters:
- `a`: The first number to multiply
- `b`: The second number to multiply

#### Temperature Conversion Tools
The temperature conversion tools provide two methods:
- `CelsiusToFahrenheit`: Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
  - `celsius`: The temperature in Celsius to convert
- `FahrenheitToCelsius`: Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
  - `fahrenheit`: The temperature in Fahrenheit to convert

#### Weather Tools
The weather tools provide real-time weather data:
- `GetAlerts`: Get active weather alerts for a US state
  - `state`: The US state code (e.g., "TX", "CA")
- `GetForecast`: Get weather forecast for a specific location
  - `latitude`: Latitude of the location
  - `longitude`: Longitude of the location

You can ask things like:
- What's the weather forecast in NYC?
- Are there any weather alerts in California?

## Deployment to Azure

The project includes an Azure deployment template (`azuredeploy.json`) that can be used to deploy the application to Azure App Service.

### Deployment Steps

1. Build the application for release:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

2. Deploy to Azure using the Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   cd src
   az login
   az webapp up
   ```
